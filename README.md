# 4-bar-simulator
This program designs and synthesizes any 4 bar mechanism.
It is an input based program that allows the user to choose either RRRR or RRRP mechanisms.
It account for non-grashof conditions and animates them.
It gives the user the option to project an animation of the mechanism at every insant and displays the graphs with their respective values.
It also gives the user the opption to collect a full 4 bar analysis at the maximum positions. This includes all angles, angular velocities, velocities, angular accelerations, accelerations.
The user also has the option to find the velocity and acceleration of any point on any given link.
Hope you enjoy this project!
